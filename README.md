I have been coding since 2012 and I still love what I do!

Today my focus is on JavaScript applications: Vue and NodeJs.

You will discover I'm a very dedicated person, always pushing myself forward. Learning is a must in our profession! I have strong skills in UI/UX, APIs and project architecture.

I invite you to get to know one dear personal project, the Celestial Oracle:

Open it up, it will make your day brighter :)
