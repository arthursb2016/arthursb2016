I have been coding since 2012 and I still love what I do!

For the past 10+ years I have been working with web applications, specialist in user interfaces and passionate about backend enterprise services. I have worked across diverse industries, including Marketing, IT, Healthcare, Real Estate, E-Commerce, and Government. This has made me easily adaptable to various business needs and challenges.

You will discover I'm a very dedicated person, always pushing myself forward. Learning is a must in our profession!

I invite you to get to know one dear personal project, the Celestial Oracle:
